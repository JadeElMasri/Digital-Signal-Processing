This project demosntrates the design of **Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)** and **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters**. The two filters were engineered in diverse ways:

For **IIR** Filter Design: **Elliptic** and **Butterworth** methods were implemented

For **FIR** Filter Design: **Parks-McClellan** algorithm wass utilized
