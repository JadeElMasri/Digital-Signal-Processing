This project demosntrates the design of **Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)** and **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters**. The two filters were engineered in diverse ways:

For **IIR** Filter Design: The filter was designed using **Elliptic** and **Butterworth**

For FIR Filter Design:

Below is a link to the report illustrating the input parameters and results for each filter design:
