This project demonstrates the design of **Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)** and **Finite Impulse Response (FIR)** filters. The filters were engineered using distinct methods:

For **IIR** Filter Design: **Elliptic** and **Butterworth** methods were implemented

For **FIR** Filter Design: **Parks-McClellan** algorithm was utilized
